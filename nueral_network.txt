algorithm is able to compute the gradient of the network’s error with regards to every sin‐
gle model parameter. In other words, it can find out how each connection weight and
each bias term should be tweaked in order to reduce the error. Once it has these gra‐
dients, it just performs a regular Gradient Descent step, and the whole process is
repeated until the network converges to the solution

if we set the confidence threshhold then if the image of other classes is given then if its lower than threshhold then it shows out of prediction
