Deployment on ZedBoard

With the boot image ready, the next step is to transfer it to the ZedBoard and boot from it.

    Boot Image Transfer:
        Copied BOOT.bin to an SD card formatted with FAT32 and labeled BOOT.
        Inserted the SD card into the ZedBoard’s SD card slot.
        Configured the ZedBoard's boot mode to boot from SD.

    Boot Verification:
        Powered on the ZedBoard to verify the system boots correctly, running initializations from the FSBL and loading application binaries.

 System Design for CNN Acceleration

To achieve the goal of accelerating CNN computations, we will divide tasks between the ARM processor and FPGA. Here’s the plan to implement this architecture:
1. User Interaction on ARM Processor

    Interface Development: Design a user interface on the ARM processor to accept input and control the CNN computations.
    Communication Handling: Program the ARM processor to manage data flow and control signals between the user interface and the CNN accelerator on the FPGA.

2. CNN Computation on FPGA

    Hardware Design for CNN Layers:
        Develop HDL or use HLS (High-Level Synthesis) to implement convolution, pooling, and ReLU layers on the FPGA.
        Ensure modular design so individual layers can be optimized and tuned for maximum speed.
    AXI Interface Configuration:
        Use AXI interconnects to set up data exchange between ARM and FPGA.
        Establish AXI DMA (Direct Memory Access) for efficient data transfer of input features and output activations.

3. Integration of ARM-FPGA Interaction

    Data Synchronization: Develop a protocol on the ARM processor to initiate, monitor, and retrieve results from FPGA-based CNN layers.
    Performance Optimization:
        Implement double buffering or pipelining on the FPGA for continuous data processing.
        Use AXI burst transactions to minimize communication latency between ARM and FPGA.

4. Deployment and Testing

    Deploy CNN Model:
        Deploy a CNN model, configure its layers on FPGA, and test with sample data.
        Adjust parameters (e.g., batch size, layer configurations) to optimize FPGA usage.
    Benchmarking and Performance Analysis:
        Measure the speedup achieved in processing time compared to running the model entirely on ARM.
        Test for various CNN model architectures and record results.
        
        
Presentation - ppt have to be done on what has been done till today , and go through the process that have been done and enquire if any and suggestions are apperciated 

also if this linux booting doesnt works we should be ready to start plan B thats softcore processing.
