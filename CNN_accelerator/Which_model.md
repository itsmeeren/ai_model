 Actually what model actually we gonna implement is lpbh (low precision binary histogram ) based haar cascade face recognizer model which i ve already built which is opencv dnn( deep nueral network) 

if you guys have any other model then we can use that too or already existing modelw we can try since the model i ve built may be complex to divide becuase i ve to train the model again to have the layers back as i  prefer use 
yaml file (saved model)
